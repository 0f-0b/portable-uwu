# portable-uwu

fast and portable uwuifier.

the output produced by this library is bit identical to that of
<https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/uwu> for the same input. unlike that
library, this library works on machines without sse4.1 support and is `no_std`.

this library requires nightly rust.
